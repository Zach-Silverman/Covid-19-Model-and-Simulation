<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap
- [] You can emulate social bubbles by clicking the social bubbles button
    - [] This simulates how when we seperate our social circles that it does a good job of limiting the spread
    - [] The wall between groups will begin closed and will slowly open after short amount of time
- [] You can have one of the social distance levels checked off at a time
    - [] This is accomplished by clicking the social distancing button
    - [] The social distancing button freezes a certain percantage of the population
    - [] As we decrease the levels of social distancing the percentage of frozen people decreases
